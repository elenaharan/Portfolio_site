    <h1>About</h1>
    <article>My name is Elena Haran, and I am currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development program at CareerFoundry, one of the most highly rated online course-providers.  My goal is to become a skilful web developer and to work in the field of education. Over twenty years, I have taught English as a foreign language to children and adults, and I worked in a variety of educational settings including public schools, universities, colleges, and language centres. Apart from being an educator, I am first and foremost a trained linguist. I have a masterâ€™s degree in linguistics, and I speak several foreign languages. My dream is to be able to create an online platform that would help people learn foreign languages in the most efficient way and to meet other language-lovers like me.  My hobbies include long-distance running, travelling and football. </article><br>
